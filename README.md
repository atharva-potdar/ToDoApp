# ToDoApp
The plan is to create a to-do and notes app to learn about multiple activities, persistent storage and more UI elements like FAB or an app bar and a menu.

My main goals for this app are:
- [ ] It should be snappy
- [ ] It should look good, adhering to Material 3 conventions
- [ ] (optional) It should autosave notes 1 second after no user interaction
- [ ] (optional) Encrypted database, hidden notes
- [ ] (optional) Import/Export functionality

First step will be research and planning, I'll find out what new concepts I need to learn and what libraries I may need to use

NOTE: This is a WIP, app may not be used in this state!
